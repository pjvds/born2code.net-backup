Google Speed

The last days I saw some tweets regarding Google PageSpeed. [Some people](https://twitter.com/philipithomas/status/341397960736784386) were invited to the beta version Google PageSpeed service and [others](https://twitter.com/mikerfulcher/status/342770162870669313) are happy that they reached a 99 out of 100 score. Since I recently moved my blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) I decided to check my score as well. I was expecting it to be at least 50 based on the fact that I'm the site is static, CSS is minified and I'm hosting on Amazon S3. Soon I find out that I'm wrong, the [Google PageSpeed Insights report](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights#url=http_3A_2F_2Fborn2code.net&mobile=false) show a score of 5 out of 100. Let's analyze the outcome and find ways to improve the site.
