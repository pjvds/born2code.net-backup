# Get the future enthusiastic for programming now!


Worlds largest bookstore is Amazon. The biggest phone company is Skype. E-mail is the largest letter distribution service. People are spending more time with software on their mobile phone than watching television (who would have expected that?). Gaming has become bigger than Holywood. In other words, software is eating the world and its hunger will not stop anytime soon.

There are still a lot of areas where software hasn't land grabt. The software that is currently inside your car is larger - in terms of lines of code - than an worlds largest operating system Linux. Airplanes can fly them self, but cars are still driven by humans. Most office workers can still be found in rush hour and this is a potential for software that could introduce an alternative. Ever called your wife to ask whether there is milk left in the fridge? Software could answer this for you.

So software is big and there is still room for growth. But I see a problem: all software must be created by humans. We call these people programmers. With the rise of software the demand for programmers also rises. I for see that the demand for software is growing faster than the supply of programmers. This can already be seen in the fact that programmers have one of the best paying jobs in the world. Scarcity is doing his job here.

Have you ever heard a young kid say that he or she wants to be a programmer? Boys want to become a police man or join the army. Why? Because the goverment did spend millions of dollars on campains and other forms propagenda. Girls want to become a nurse because of the same reason. But I wouldn't blame the goverment. Airflight companies did the same. They created action figures to _get them when they are young_.

Research has already shown that your childhood has big impact on your job choice. We should levage this to get more children exited for one of the greatest jobs in the world. And all it needs is a handful of programmers that share there enthousiasm use their experience to let children experience the fun of programming.
