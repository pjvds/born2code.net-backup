Hi, my name is __Pieter Joost van de Sande__ and I’m a __software engineer__ for almost a decade.

I'm currently employed by [wercker](https://wercker.com), a startup based in Amsterdam. We are building an integral software delivery platform in the cloud. At wercker I mainly write Javascript, Python, Go and Bash Script. Next to writing code I'm responsible for community engagement.
Previously I was a thought leader at [atos](http://atos.net/), one of worlds leading international information technology services companies. I received the Atos TRP award which made me a [distinguished member of technical staff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_technical_staff).

Next to the employment I play an active role in the software development community. I've presented at conferences like Microsoft TechDays, Software Development Conference and NDC. Beside speaking I'm also a frequent visitor of smaller meetups. I'm a board member at [Devnology](http://devnology.nl) where I help to organise meetings and run a [software development podcast](http://devnology.nl/en/podcast). My active role in the community is recognised by Microsoft who awarded me with the exclusive [Microsoft MVP](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/default.aspx) award.

I'm also active in the software development community. I've contributed to various open source projects like, [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), [ncqrs](http://github.com/ncqrs/ncqrs), [node-auth](https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth), [ssh-keygen](https://github.com/ericvicenti/ssh-keygen), [Neo4jClient](https://bitbucket.org/Readify/neo4jclient), [EventStore](https://github.com/joliver/EventStore) and [many more](https://github.com/pjvds). As you can see at my [Github profile](https://github.com/pjvds) the  contributions are not bound to a specific programming language. I like to explore different languages and paradigms. I count [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa287558.aspx) as one of worlds most beautiful programming languages, but you also find me writing [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript), [Python](http://www.python.org/), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) [Smalltalk](http://smalltalk.org) and [Go](http://golang.org/).

To clear my head and recharge my batteries I run. I prefer the trails and when the surface allows I run [barefoot](http://barefootrunning.com/). If not, I run in [Luna Sandals](https://www.lunasandals.com/).

## Colophon

The reason this website looks awesome is [David Ensinger](http://davidensinger.com/). I used his site design as a foundation for this one. I develop mainly on a [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) (can't live without a retina display anymore). [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is my primarily editor. Type is set in [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which is served by [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). Posts are composed in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which I write in [Mou](http://mouapp.com) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and syntax is highlighted with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

The site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Amazone S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The process to generation and deployment is automated with [wercker](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/c38587366b136b180eb7108c9c250cdc).

The DNS for [born2code.net](http://born2code.net) is served by [Amazon Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/‎), Amazon's high available and scalable domain name system. This allows me to host this blog at a naked domain (a domain without www).

The source code is hosted at [github](http://github.com) in the repository [pjvds/born2code](http://github.com/pjvds/born2code). You are free to fork or steel anything you find useful.

A number of supporting plugins and code snippets for Jekyll are used with the site:

- [Jekyll Templates for Atom, RSS](http://davecoyle.com/tech-notes/jekyll-templates-for-atom-rss/) by [Dave Coyle](http://davecoyle.com/)
- [Open Graph for Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/pathawks/1406355) by [Pat Hawks](http://alt.pathawks.com/)
- [Paginate Like a Boss](http://schmidt-happens.com/articles/2012/01/11/setup-pagination-for-jekyll-driven-sites.html) by [Terry Schmidt](http://schmidt-happens.com/)
- [Jekyll: Category and Tag Paging and Feeds](http://realjenius.com/2012/12/01/jekyll-category-tag-paging-feeds/) by [R.J. Lorimer](http://realjenius.com/)
- [sitemap.xml](https://github.com/havvg/havvg.github.com/blob/master/sitemap.xml) by [Toni Uebernickel](http://toni.uebernickel.info/)

A couple Sass mixins proved integral to the scaffolding of the site:

- [Rem mixin](https://gist.github.com/webgefrickel/4530526) by [Steffen Becker](http://webgefrickel.de/)
